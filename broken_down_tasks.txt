**Question 1: How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?**
1. Filter rows where the 'Worldwide gross' column is greater than or equal to 2000000000.
2. From the filtered data, select rows where the 'Year' column is less than 2000.
3. Count the number of resulting rows.
4. Return the final count.

**Question 2: Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?**
1. Filter rows where the 'Worldwide gross' column is greater than or equal to 1500000000.
2. Sort the filtered data by the 'Year' column in ascending order.
3. Select the first row of the sorted data.
4. Return the value from the 'Title' column for that row.

**Question 3: What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?**
1. Select the 'Rank' and 'Peak' columns, ensuring they are both numeric types.
2. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 'Rank' and 'Peak' columns.
3. Return the calculated correlation coefficient.

**Question 4: Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it. Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."` under 100,000 bytes.**
1. Create a scatterplot using the 'Rank' column for the x-axis and the 'Peak' column for the y-axis.
2. Calculate and draw a linear regression line on the plot, styled as a dotted red line.
3. Render the plot into an in-memory PNG image format.
4. Encode the PNG image data into a base64 string.
5. Return the resulting string formatted as a data URI: "data:image/png;base64,{encoded_string}".
